How to Run The Python Script
# Permissions: You will need administrator privileges to run this script effectively, especially to kill processes and delete certain files.
Operating System: The script is designed for Windows (as indicated by the file paths and typical malware file types). You will need to modify file paths and possibly other elements for other operating systems like Linux or macOS.
Environment: It's highly recommended to test this script in a controlled environment before deploying it anywhere critical. This can prevent the accidental deletion of important files or the termination of essential services.

If your .exe files have been affected by malware or have been accidentally deleted, restoring them will depend on a few factors:

# Backup: If you have a backup of your .exe files, you can easily restore them from there.
System Restore: If you're using Windows, you can try using the System Restore feature to revert your system to a previous point in time when the .exe files were intact.
Antivirus or Antimalware Scan: Run a thorough scan of your system using reputable antivirus or antimalware software. Some malware may hide or corrupt .exe files, and a scan may help to detect and restore them.
Check Quarantine: If your antivirus or antimalware software has a quarantine feature, check there to see if any .exe files have been quarantined and restore them if needed.
Manual Reinstallation: If the .exe files are part of software you've installed, you may need to reinstall the affected software to restore the .exe files.
Download from Official Source: For system files or software you've downloaded from official sources, you can redownload them and reinstall.
File Recovery Tools: If the .exe files have been deleted but not overwritten, you might be able to recover them using file recovery tools. However, this is not guaranteed to work, especially if the files have been overwritten or if the drive has been heavily used since deletion.
